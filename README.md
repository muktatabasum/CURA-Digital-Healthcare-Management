# CURA-Digital-Healthcare-Management
The platform is structured around three main user roles—patients, doctors, and administrators—each with their own dedicated login portal and dashboard. This ensures that every user has access to the tools and information they need, tailored to their specific role.
On the homepage, visitors can easily book appointments with expert doctors, whether they’re new or returning patients. The “Our Healthcare Services” section highlights the range of services CURA offers, such as online consultations via video calls, emergency care information, pharmacy services with home delivery, lab tests with at-home sample collection, secure digital health records, and personalized wellness programs.

We also have a “Meet Our Expert Doctors” section, where users can browse through our list of doctors, view their specialties, years of experience, and even see ratings from other patients. This helps build trust and transparency.

The “Why Choose CURA” section outlines the platform’s main benefits—security, privacy, speed, and affordability. Finally, the “Get In Touch” section provides multiple ways for users to contact us, including an emergency hotline, live chat, email support, and a contact form.
Starting with the Doctor Portal, doctors have a dashboard showing today’s appointments, urgent cases, and issued prescriptions. They can manage their patient list, view and schedule appointments on a calendar, create and manage e-prescriptions, and securely message patients.

For patients, the portal provides a dashboard with key health metrics like heart rate, blood pressure, daily steps, and sleep quality. There’s a symptom tracker, a personal wellness dashboard for tracking water intake, exercise, and meditation, as well as features for managing medications and upcoming appointments. Quick actions allow patients to contact emergency services, export health data, or schedule appointments with just a click.

The Admin Portal gives administrators a high-level summary of the system, including total doctors, patients, appointments, and revenue. Admins can manage doctor and patient records, and oversee all appointments from a centralized view.
CURA is more than a project—it’s a vision for the future of healthcare. We’re bringing people together, breaking down barriers, and making healthcare accessible for everyone, everywhere.

Thank you for joining us on this journey.
